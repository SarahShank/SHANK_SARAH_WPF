//RELATIONAL OPERATORS comparing two variables or values
//greater than               >
//less than                   <
//greater than or equal to   >=
//less than or equal to      <=

//EQUALITY OPERATORS
//equality                  ==  exp. a==b
// strict equality          === * better than ==
//inequality                !=  exp. a!=b


//exp. 5 < 5 = false
//     5 <= 5 = true

//statements logically the same
// a > b   b < a
